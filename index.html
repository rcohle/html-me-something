  <article class="intro">
    <p>Since childhood, I've enjoyed drawing. When I became comfortable using a computer, I started 
        using graphics programs to create digital artwork. The main program I create art in is the Gimp, 
        which is a free graphics program. I have also used Paint Shop Pro 7 and Microsoft Paint.</p>
      
    <p>I believe anyone with curiosity and a bit of time can make digital artwork! There are tons of video
         and text tutorials out there. The concept of layers has taken my digital artwork to a more sophisticated 
         level.</p>

  <h2>Animals</h2>
  
    <p>When I was a kid, I was obsessed with horses and loved drawing them. At first, my drawings were really bad 
      (even for a kid). But with consistent practice and studying drawing books, I became much better. These days, 
      I prefer drawing cats to horses. Below are some examples of my digital animal creations:</p>

        <img class="resize" src="images/animals/wolf.jpg" alt="digital art">

        <img class="resize" src="images/animals/amoeba.jpg" alt="digital art">
      </div>
  
  <h2>People</h2>

    <p>After animals, people are my most favorite subject for artwork, especially faces. 
    Here a few of my creations:</p>

      <div>
        <img class="resize" src="images/people/bwgirl.jpg" alt="digital art">
        <img class="resize" src="images/people/angrygirl.jpg" alt="digital art">
        <img class="resize" src="images/people/coolguy.jpg" alt="digital art">
        <img class="resize" src="images/people/eyeonpaper.jpg" alt="digital art">
        <img class="resize" src="images/people/glasses.jpg" alt="digital art">
        <img class="resize" src="images/people/sad.jpg" alt="digital art">
        <img class="resize" src="images/people/thinkinggirl.jpg" alt="digital art">
        <img class="resize" src="images/people/yell.jpg" alt="digital art">
      </div>

  <h2>Nature</h2>

    <p>I love taking pictures in nature, but drawing nature scenes are more difficult for me. 
    That's why there are fewer creations here than in my other subjects.</p>

      <div>
        <img class="resize" src="images/nature/mountainstorm.jpg" alt="digital art">
        <img class="resize" src="images/nature/winter.jpg" alt="digital art">
      </div>

  <h2>Abstract</h2>

    <p>Digital abstract images are often my favorite to create because there are no rules. 
    I have the freedom to explore various elements of the graphics software without feeling 
    restrained, and it's super fun!</p>
      <div>
        <img class="resize" src="images/abstract/dancer.jpg" alt="digital art">
        <img class="resize" src="images/abstract/22.jpg" alt="digital art">
        <img class="resize" src="images/abstract/23.jpg" alt="digital art">
        <img class="resize" src="images/abstract/17.jpg" alt="digital art">
        <img class="resize" src="images/abstract/14.jpg" alt="digital art">
      </div>
